**Project Title: Customer Segmentation and Recommendation System**

**Project Description:**
The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and create a recommendation system based on their behavior and preferences.  

**Steps Involved:**

1. **Data Collection:** Obtain a dataset containing information about customer transactions, such as purchase history, product details, customer demographics, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Standardize and clean up the data format.
   - Remove duplicates and outliers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Performing basic statistical analysis to understand the distribution of variables.
   - Visualize trends and patterns in the data.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new features that might be relevant for segmentation (e.g., total spending, frequency of purchases, etc.).
   - Encode categorical variables if necessary.

5. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Use techniques like clustering (e.g., K-Means,scipy) to group customers based on their behavior.
   - Analyze and interpret the segments.

6. **Recommendation System:**
   - Build a simple recommendation system i.e collaborative filtering to suggest products to customers within each segment.

7. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics (e.g., precision, recall).

8. **Documentation and Presentation:**
   - Create a report or presentation summarizing your findings, methodology, and insights gained from the project and plotting the same.

**Technologies and Tools:**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for clustering)
- Jupyter Notebook (for coding and documentation)
- Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
